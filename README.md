# [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ngbp/ngbp.png?branch=v0.3.2-release)](https://travis-ci.org/ngbp/ngbp)

An opinionated version of an opinionated [kickstarter](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate) for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

Fork with the following goals:
- Coffee script by default
- Change build systems from Grunt to Gulp (It's much faster, and more understandable for me. Code > Configuration)
- Include SASS and Bourbon / Neat / Bitters / some Refills

***

## Quick Start

When this works...

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/metermaid/ngbp
$ cd ngbp
$ sudo npm -g gulp karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp

```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/ngbp/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!
